# Howdy! 🤠 My name is Nicholas (he/him) 

I'm Nicholas, a second-year Software Engineering student from the University of Waterloo. I've been exploring a lot of Full Stack, but I'm pretty much interested in learning and exploring anything related to software development at the moment 😄. You can check out some of my past projects below. Feel free to reach out if you have questions, or just want to chat!

⚡ In my free time, I enjoy playing Minecraft, Valorant, badminton, and occasionally basketball (kind of an NBA stats nerd)
