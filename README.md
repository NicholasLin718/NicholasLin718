# Howdy! 🤠 My name is Nicholas (he/him) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I'm Nicholas, a first-year Software Engineering student from the University of Waterloo. I've recently started trying out web development, but I'm pretty much interested in learning and exploring anything related to software development at the moment 😄. You can check out some of my past projects below. Feel free to reach out if you have questions, or just want to chat!

⚡ In my free time, I enjoy playing Minecraft, badminton, and occasionally basketball (kind of an NBA stats nerd)
